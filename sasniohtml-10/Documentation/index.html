				<div id="accordion">
					
					<h2>How to manage gaps between the sections?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>For the top and bottom spacing for each section, the class <code>"gap"</code>has been used, which applies 120 pixels spacing to the section both from the top and bottom.</p>
						<p>You can manage the inter-section spacing easily according to your page flow.When you use sections one after another, the spacing between the two sections becomes 120 pixels as the bottom space of the top section and the top space of the bottom section will join, and it will become awkward spacing.To manage this spacing between the consecutive sections use class <code>"no-bottom"</code> with the <code>"gap"</code> class in the section from which you want to avoid top space.</p>
						<p><code>&lt;div class="no-top" </code></p>
						
					</div>

	<h2>How to define your own new color scheme?</h2>
	<div class="content">
		<p>If you wish to change the color scheme of the template, it is very easy to define and apply it. Go to the "assets" folder. You will find "css" folder inside it. In this folder, you can locate "color.css" file. Open it in the editor. You will see a long list of classes separated with commas (,). Here you need to change the css properties for the background, color and border. For this purpose, just change the color code in that file and the color scheme will be changed in the whole template.</p>
